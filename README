NOTE: This is an alpha release of these scripts.

Description:
This subdirectory contains the chef cookbooks to deploy and setup Cloud Foundry
in a single or multiple host environment. The cookbooks assume that they are
running on a freshly installed Ubuntu 10.04.4 server.

Quick Start:
-----------
   To Deploy:
      vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup

         It will download Cloud Foundry source code into
            $HOME/cloudfoundry/vcap

         It will create a default deployment named 'devbox' under
            $HOME/cloudfoundry/.deployments/devbox

   To Start:
      vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev start

   To Stop:
      vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev stop


More Options:
------------

o To use Cloud Foundry source code that you have already downloaded.
   To Deploy:
     e.g. If Cloud Foundry source is downloaded into $HOME/projects/vcap.

      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup -d $HOME/projects

        It will not download Cloud Foundry source code. It will just setup the config files to
        use the Cloud Foundry source code from $HOME/projects/vcap.

        It will create a default deployment named 'devbox' under
          $HOME/projects/.deployment/devbox

   To Start:
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev -d $HOME/projects start

   To Stop::
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev -d $HOME/projects stop

o To use a custom deployment config
  e.g. If you want to use the multihost sample config file
  $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/deployments/sample/multihost_mysql/dea.yml

   To Deploy:
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup -d $HOME/projects -c $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/deployments/sample/multihost_mysql/dea.yml

        It will not download Cloud Foundry source code. It will just setup the config files to
        use the Cloud Foundry source code from $HOME/projects/vcap.

        It will create a deployment named 'dea' under
          $HOME/projects/.deployment/dea

   To Start:
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev -d $HOME/projects -n dea start

   To Stop:
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev -d $HOME/projects -n dea stop

o To use a custom domain
  e.g. If you do not want your CloudFoundry domain as vcap.me
  $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup -D myowndomain.com

  Later, you will target your CloudFoundry installation with:
    vmc target api.myowndomain.com

o Service backup:
  By default, backup feature is disabled. If you want to enable this feature, you could run
  a script:
    $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_service_backup_ctl start|stop|restart|status <service_type>

  service_type is optional, it could be one of services which support backup feature or all of these
  when service_type is empty.

  start|restart: add lines to crontab
  stop:  remove lines from crontab
  status: get lines from crontab

  If you want to clean the backups that belongs to the service instance which is un-provisioned, you
  should use the backup manager.

  By default, backup_manager is not installed, you should add "backup_manager" in your deployment config file, and
  re-run vcap_dev_setup.
    $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup -c <your config file>
    $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev start backup_manager

o Service lifecycle:
  By default, service lifecycle feature is disabled.
  If you want to enable this feature, please add the below items in your deployment config file.
    - services_redis
    - serialization_data_server
    - snapshot_manager
    - redis_worker
    - mysql_worker
    - mongodb_worker
    - postgresql_worker
  Then, re-run vcap_dev_setup and start.
    $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup -c <your config file>
    $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev restart

  snapshot_manager is used to clean the snapshots which belong to the service un-provisioned instances.

o To deploy all the components:
  By default, vcap_dev_setup uses "$HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/deployments/devbox.yml" as the deployment
  config file, containing most components in cloudfoundry, but not all.
  To deploy all the components, see below:
    $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup -c $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/deployments/devbox_all.yml
    $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev start

NOTE: To learn more about custom deployment config files and multi host setups
see the README file vcap/dev_setup/deployments/README.
